### Investigate Azure Database Services
- Cosmos DB → Globally distributed, low-latency NoSQL apps

- Table Storage → Simple, cheap key-value storage

- Azure SQL Database → Structured data with relationships and transactions

- Blob Storage → Large-scale unstructured data (not a true database)

### Evaluate and Choose

Azure Cosmos DB was the optimal choice for this lab because:

- 1- It natively supports JSON, which matches the structure of your text analysis results.

- 2- The serverless tier minimizes costs for a student or experimental project.

- 3- Schema-less design reduces setup complexity, especially for dynamic or nested data.

- 4- It scales automatically, aligning perfectly with serverless Azure Functions.

- 5- Python SDK support is robust, simplifying integration with your function code.

- 6- Querying historical results is straightforward, enabling filtering, ordering, and limiting of results.
